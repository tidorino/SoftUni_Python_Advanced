"""
The current project is assembly-line robots.
Each robot has a processing time â€“ it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product.
When a robot is free, it should take a product for processing and log its name, product, and processing start time.
Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line. A product is coming from the line each second
(so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]).
If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it, it should be queued at the end of the line again.
The robots are standing in the line in the order of their appearance.
